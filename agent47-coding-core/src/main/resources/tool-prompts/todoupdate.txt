Update an existing todo item by ID. Only the fields you provide will be changed.

## Parameters

- id (required): The todo item ID (use todoread to find IDs)
- content (optional): Updated task description
- status (optional): Updated status. Values: pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled
- priority (optional): Updated priority. Values: high, medium, low

## Common Workflows

- Mark a task as started: set status to "in_progress"
- Mark a task as done: set status to "completed"
- Cancel a task that is no longer needed: set status to "cancelled"
- Reprioritize: update the priority field
- Clarify scope: update the content field

## Tips

- Use todoread first to get item IDs
- Update status in real-time as you work through tasks
- Mark tasks complete immediately after finishing (don't batch completions)
- Only have one task as in_progress at a time
