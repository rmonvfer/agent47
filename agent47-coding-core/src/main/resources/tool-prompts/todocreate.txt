Create a single todo item and add it to the list. An ID is auto-generated.

## Parameters

- content (required): Brief, actionable description of the task
- status (optional): Initial status, defaults to "pending". Values: pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled
- priority (optional): Priority level, defaults to "medium". Values: high, medium, low

## Best Practices

- Create specific, actionable items with clear descriptions
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Only have one todo as in_progress at a time
- Set priority to "high" for blocking or time-sensitive work
- Use this tool instead of todowrite when adding a single item to an existing list
