Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: line number + colon + space (e.g., `1: `). Everything after that space is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the oldText or newText.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if `oldText` is not found in the file with an error "oldText not found in content".
- The edit will FAIL if `oldText` is found multiple times in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique.
- When you need to make multiple edits to the same file, prefer the MultiEdit tool over calling Edit multiple times.
